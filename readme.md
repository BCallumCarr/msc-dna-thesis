# This is the repo for my MSc thesis at the London School of Economics

My aim was to predict community engagement on monthly StackOverflow data obtained with Google Big Query, using only textual content of questions available at the time of question submission.


* The `00-article` folder contains the final pdf version of my thesis, as well as the tex and Rmd files used to render it
* The `00-presentations` folder contains an early html presentation of my thesis idea that I gave in February 2019
* The `01-python-code` folder contains my final workspace consisting of python files, some bash files, output folders for graphs and results, and the jupyter notebooks where I conducted my analysis
