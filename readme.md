# This is the repo for my MSc thesis at the London School of Economics

My aim was to use Natural Language Processing and Latent Dirichlet Allocation to predict community engagement on monthly StackOverflow data obtained with Google Big Query. I used only textual content of questions available at the time of question submission, and implemented the analysis with Python and PySpark.


* The `00-article` folder contains my final thesis article, as well as the tex and Rmd files used to render it
* The `00-presentations` folder contains an early html presentation of my thesis idea that I gave in February 2019
* The `01-python-code` folder contains my final workspace consisting of python files, bash files, output folders for graphs and results, and the master jupyter notebook where I conducted my analysis
