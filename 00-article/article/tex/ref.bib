We present LDA-SP, which utilizes LinkLDA (Erosheva et al., 2004) to model selectional preferences. By simultaneously inferring latent topics and topic distributions over relations, LDA-SP combines the benefits of previous approaches: like traditional class-based approaches, it produces human-interpretable classes describing each relation's preferences, but it is competitive with non-class-based methods in predictive power. We compare LDA-SP to several state-of-the-art methods achieving an 85{\%} increase in recall at 0.9 precision over mutual information (Erk, 2007). We also evaluate LDA-SP's effectiveness at filtering improper applications of inference rules, where we show substantial improvement over Pantel et al.'s system (Pantel et al., 2007).},

abstract = {With the advent of Web 2.0, people became more eager to express and share their opinions on web regarding day-to-day activities and global issues as well. Evolution of social media has also contributed immensely to these activities, thereby providing us a transparent platform to share views across the world. These electronic Word of Mouth (eWOM) statements expressed on the web are much prevalent in business and service industry to enable customer to share his/her point of view. In the last one and half decades, research communities, academia, public and service industries are working rigorously on sentiment analysis, also known as, opinion mining, to extract and analyze public mood and views. In this regard, this paper presents a rigorous survey on sentiment analysis, which portrays views presented by over one hundred articles published in the last decade regarding necessary tasks, approaches, and applications of sentiment analysis. Several sub-tasks need to be performed for sentiment analysis which in turn can be accomplished using various approaches and techniques. This survey covering published literature during 2002-2015, is organized on the basis of sub-tasks to be performed, machine learning and natural language processing techniques used and applications of sentiment analysis. The paper also presents open issues and along with a summary table of a hundred and sixty-one articles.},

abstract = {A matching in a two-sided market often incurs an externality: a matched resource may become unavailable to the other side of the market, at least for a while. This is especially an issue in online platforms involving human experts as the expert resources are often scarce. The efficient utilization of experts in these platforms is made challenging by the fact that the information available about the parties involved is usually limited. To address this challenge, we develop a model of a task-expert matching system where a task is matched to an expert using not only the prior information about the task but also the feedback obtained from the past matches. In our model the tasks arrive online while the experts are fixed and constrained by a finite service capacity. For this model, we characterize the maximum task resolution throughput a platform can achieve. We show that the natural greedy approaches where each expert is assigned a task most suitable to her skill is suboptimal, as it does not internalize the above externality. We develop a throughput optimal backpressure algorithm which does so by accounting for the `congestion' among different task types. Finally, we validate our model and confirm our theoretical findings with data-driven simulations via logs of Math.StackExchange, a StackOverflow forum dedicated to mathematics.},

abstract = {Users tend to ask and answer questions in community question answering (CQA) services to seek information and share knowledge. A corollary is that myriad of questions and answers appear in CQA service. Accordingly, volumes of studies have been taken to explore the answer quality so as to provide a preliminary screening for better answers. However, to our knowledge, less attention has so far been paid to question quality in CQA. Knowing question quality provides us with finding and recommending good questions together with identifying bad ones which hinder the CQA service. In this paper, we are conducting two studies to investigate the question quality issue. The first study analyzes the factors of question quality and finds that the interaction between askers and topics results in the differences of question quality. Based on this finding, in the second study we propose a Mutual Reinforcement-based Label Propagation (MRLP) algorithm to predict question quality. We experiment with Yahoo!{\~{}}Answers data and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in distinguishing high-quality questions from low-quality ones.},

abstract = {Inferring the sentiment of social media content, for instance blog posts and forum threads, is both of great interest to security analysts and technically challenging to accomplish. This paper presents a new method for estimating social media sentiment which addresses the challenges associated with Web-based analysis. The approach formulates the task as one of learning-based text classification, models the data as a bipartite graph of documents and words, and provides accurate sentiment estimation using only a small lexicon of words of known sentiment orientation, in particular, good performance is obtained without the need for labeled training documents. This capability for effective learning without (labeled) exemplar documents is realized by 1.)exploiting the information present in unlabeled documents and words, which are abundant online, and 2.) appropriately smoothing the sentiment polarity estimates for documents and words in the bipartite graph data model. The utility of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through implementation with a "standard"sentiment analysis task involving online consumer product reviews. Additionally, we illustrate the potential of the method for security informatics by inferring regional public opinion regarding the Egyptian revolution via analysis of Arabic, Indonesian, and Danish blog posts.},

A growing number of research studies focus on the methodological aspects of the use of social media data as indicators of mental health and its causes. Although there is a myriad of opportunities available to researchers interested in incorporating social media data for behavioral science research, there are nonetheless several challenges inherent to this work. A key limitation is that the data are not representative of the general population and may be biased in several ways. There is a likely spatial bias to be expected when working with geo-social data. The current study is of particular interest as it opens up several pathways for the social and medical sciences to investigate health-related behavior in the ever-increasing populations engaging with social media platforms. This includes continuing to work on validation of extracted measures from social media and to fully exploit available social media information to systematically assess mental health risk at multiple levels of analysis, through social networks, and across spatial-temporal dimensions.

abstract = {Community-based question answering(CQA) services such asYahoo! Answers have been widely used by Internet users to get the answers for their inquiries. The CQA services totally rely on the contributions by the users. However, it is known that newcomers are prone to lose their interests and leave the communities. Thus, finding expert users in an early phase when they are still active is essential to improve the chances of motivating them to contribute to the communities further. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to discovering “potentially” contributive users from recently-joined users in CQAservices. The likelihood of becoming a contributive user is defined by the user's expertise as well as availability, which we call the answer affordance. The main technical difficulty lies in the fact that such recently-joined users do not have abundant information accumulated for many years. We uti- lize a user's productive vocabulary to mitigate the lack of available information since the vocabulary is the most fun- damental element that reveals his/her knowledge. Extensive experiments were conducted with a huge data set of Naver Knowledge-In (KiN), which is the dominating CQA service in Korea.We demonstrate that the top rankers selected by the answer affordance outperformed those by KiN in terms of the amount of answering activity.

abstract = {Question answering (Q{\&}A) websites are now large repositories of valuable knowledge. While most Q{\&}A sites were initially aimed at providing useful answers to the question asker, there has been a marked shift towards question answering as a community-driven knowledge creation process whose end product can be of enduring value to a broad audience. As part of this shift, specific expertise and deep knowledge of the subject at hand have become increasingly important, and many Q{\&}A sites employ voting and reputation mechanisms as centerpieces of their design to help users identify the trustworthiness and accuracy of the content. To better understand this shift in focus from one-off answers to a group knowledge-creation process, we consider a question together with its entire set of corresponding answers as our fundamental unit of analysis, in contrast with the focus on individual questionanswer pairs that characterized previous work. Our investigation considers the dynamics of the community activity that shapes the set of answers, both how answers and voters arrive over time and how this influences the eventual outcome. For example, we observe significant assortativity in the reputations of co-answerers, relationships between reputation and answer speed, and that the probability of an answer being chosen as the best one strongly depends on temporal characteristics of answer arrivals. We then show that our understanding of such properties is naturally applicable to predicting several important quantities, including the long-term value of the question and its answers, as well as whether a question requires a better answer. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the design of Q{\&}A sites.},

abstract = {Kernel classifiers and regressors designed for structured data, such as sequences, trees and graphs, have significantly advanced a number of interdisciplinary areas such as computational biology and drug design. Typically, kernels are designed beforehand for a data type which either exploit statistics of the structures or make use of probabilistic generative models, and then a discriminative classifier is learned based on the kernels via convex optimization. However, such an elegant two-stage approach also limited kernel methods from scaling up to millions of data points, and exploiting discriminative information to learn feature representations. We propose, structure2vec, an effective and scalable approach for structured data representation based on the idea of embedding latent variable models into feature spaces, and learning such feature spaces using discriminative information. Interestingly, structure2vec extracts features by performing a sequence of function mappings in a way similar to graphical model inference procedures, such as mean field and belief propagation. In applications involving millions of data points, we showed that structure2vec runs 2 times faster, produces models which are {\$}10,000{\$} times smaller, while at the same time achieving the state-of-the-art predictive performance.},

However, we know much less about how influence works among relative strangers in digital public squares, despite important conversations happening in such spaces. We present the results of a study on large public Facebook pages where we randomly used two different methods--most recent and social feedback--to order comments on posts. We find that the social feedback condition results in higher quality viewed comments and response comments. After measuring the average quality of comments written by users before the study, we find that social feedback has a positive effect on response quality for both low and high quality commenters. We draw on a theoretical framework of social norms to explain this empirical result. In order to examine the influence mechanism further, we measure the similarity between comments viewed and written during the study, finding that similarity increases for the highest quality contributors under the social feedback condition. This suggests that, in addition to norms, some individuals may respond with increased relevance to high-quality comments.},

abstract = {Question answering (QA) helps one go beyond traditional keywords-based querying and retrieve information in more precise form than given by a document or a list of documents. Several community-based QA (CQA) services have emerged allowing information seekers pose their information need as questions and receive answers from their fellow users. A question may receive multiple answers from multiple users and the asker or the community can choose the best answer. While the asker can thus indicate if he was satisfied with the information he received, there is no clear way of evaluating the quality of that information. We present a study to evaluate and predict the quality of an answer in a CQA setting. We chose Yahoo! Answers as such CQA service and selected a small set of questions, each with at least five answers. We asked Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to rate the quality of each answer for a given question based on 13 different criteria. Each answer was rated by five different workers. We then matched their assessments with the actual asker's rating of a given answer. We show that the quality criteria we used faithfully match with asker's perception of a quality answer. We furthered our investigation by extracting various features from questions, answers, and the users who posted them, and training a number of classifiers to select the best answer using those features. We demonstrate a high predictability of our trained models along with the relative merits of each of the features for such prediction. These models support our argument that in case of CQA, contextual information such as a user's profile, can be critical in evaluating and predicting content quality.},

We focus on finding experts for a newly posted question. We investigate the suitability of two statistical topic models for solving this issue and compare these methods against more traditional Information Retrieval approaches.

abstract = {The quality of user-generated content varies drastically from excellent to abuse and spam. As the availability of such content increases, the task of identifying high-quality content in sites based on user contributions—social media sites— becomes increasingly important. Social media in general exhibit a rich variety of information sources: in addition to the content itself, there is a wide array of non-content information available, such as links between items and explicit quality ratings from members of the community. In this paper we investigate methods for exploiting such community feedback to automatically identify high quality content. As a test case, we focus on Yahoo! Answers, a large community question/answering portal that is particularly rich in the amount and types of content and social interactions available in it. We introduce a general classification framework for combining the evidence from different sources of information, that can be tuned automatically for a given social media type and quality definition. In particular, for the community question/answering domain, we show that our system is able to separate high-quality items from the rest with an accuracy close to that of humans.},

abstract = {This study uses a unique dataset to investigate university access, throughput, and dropout for the 2008 national matric cohort. The findings show that university access in South Africa is limited, even among learners who perform relatively well in matric. In addition, those who do gain access to university often take a long time to complete their studies, with many never completing at all. As a result, only a select minority of matric learners manage to obtain university qualifications. Significant inequalities in university outcomes between race groups and across geographical space also remain evident. However, the results from the analysis suggests that observed patterns of university access and university success are strongly influenced by school results. The weak school system has a major influence on who reaches matric, and how they perform in matric. This, and particularly the achievement of Bachelor passes, explains much of the differences in university outcomes by race, gender and province.},

abstract = {Homophily, the tendency of people to associate with others similar to themselves, is observed in many social networks, ranging from friendships to marriages to business relationships, and is based on a variety of characteristics, including race, age, gender, religion, and education. We present a technique for distinguishing two primary sources of homophily: biases in the preferences of individuals over the types of their friends and biases in the chances that people meet individuals of other types. We use this technique to analyze racial patterns in friendship networks in a set of American high schools from the Add Health dataset. Biases in preferences and biases in meeting rates are both highly significant in these data, and both types of biases differ significantly across races. Asians and Blacks are biased toward interacting with their own race at rates {\textgreater}7 times higher than Whites, whereas Hispanics exhibit an intermediate bias in meeting opportunities. Asians exhibit the least preference bias, valuing friendships with other types 90{\%} as much as friendships with Asians, whereas Blacks and Hispanics value friendships with other types 55{\%} and 65{\%} as much as same-type friendships, respectively, and Whites fall in between, valuing other-type friendships 75{\%} as much as friendships with Whites. Meetings are significantly more biased in large schools ({\textgreater}1,000 students) than in small schools ({\textless}1,000 students), and biases in preferences exhibit some significant variation with the median household income levels in the counties surrounding the schools.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTWith the advances in interpersonal communication of the ``Web 2.0'' era, questions about the importance of civility are perhaps more important than ever. Mass digital interaction between strangers has become an everyday occurrence, bound by few behavioral norms. I argue that the widespread presence of incivility in online political communication limits the deliberative potential of online interactions. To test this hypothesis, I manipulate exposure to uncivil political discourse in an online discussion forum. I find that exposure to disagreeable uncivil political talk induces feelings of anger and aversion, which in turn reduces satisfaction with the message board discourse. On the other hand, exposure to like-minded incivility increases the use of uncivil behavior in political comments by message board posters. Notably, these effects mainly occur when histrionic, emotional incivility is present. I discuss why like-minded and disagreeable incivility have different effects, and reflect on what the presence of incivility means for online political discourse.},

abstract = {Academic success of students has been explained with a variety of individual and socioeconomic factors. Social networks that informally emerge within student communities can have an additional effect on their achievement. However, this effect of social ties is difficult to measure and quantify, because social networks are multidimensional and dynamically evolving within the educational context. We repeatedly surveyed a cohort of 226 engineering undergraduates between their first day at university and a crucial examination at the end of the academic year. We investigate how social networks emerge between previously unacquainted students and how integration in these networks explains academic success. Our study measures multiple important dimensions of social ties between students: their positive interactions, friendships, and studying relations. By using statistical models for dynamic network data, we are able to investigate the processes of social network formation in the cohort. We find that friendship ties informally evolve into studying relationships over the academic year. This process is crucial, as studying together with others, in turn, has a strong impact on students' success at the examination. The results are robust to individual differences in socioeconomic background factors and to various indirect measures of cognitive abilities, such as prior academic achievement and being perceived as smart by other students. The findings underline the importance of understanding social network dynamics in educational settings. They call for the creation of university environments promoting the development of positive relationships in pursuit of academic success. social networks | sociology of education | network dynamics | network science | computational social science I n the fall of 2016, a cohort of 226 engineering students started their undergraduate studies at one of the world's leading universities. They knew that their study program was considered one of the most competitive in Europe and that, instead of a university entrance test, they had to pass a challenging examination at the end of the first year. The ones who succeed , typically {\textless}50{\%}, are likely to eventually take prestigious jobs in industry or academia. The ones who fail are at risk of leaving the university without a degree. But what determines academic success and failure? The first factors that may come to mind are individual, like students' smartness, their willingness to work hard, and their socioeconomic background (1-3). But it is hard to succeed alone. Social science research has shown that access to social support is another important factor in academic success (4, 5) and that individuals' positions in social networks can explain success in many domains of life (6-9). We closely followed the cohort of students over the course of their first year to better understand how social networks emerge within the student community and how much integration in these networks explains success in the final examination. We find that students who remained isolated in the network performed worse and were at higher risk of academic failure, even when taking into account various individual and socioeconomic factors: These students might have fallen through the network. Social networks are dynamic and complex systems (10-13); therefore, their impact on academic achievement is difficult to study. We argue that it is not sufficient to assess students' integration in social networks in critical periods (e.g., when they prepare for a crucial examination), but it is equally important to understand how those networks evolved in the months and years before. The social networks between students in this study were basically nonexistent before their first university day, as 81{\%} of them had just moved from other cities or countries. By the end of the first year, however, 549 friendship ties emerged, and 61{\%} of the participating students reported that one of their best friends in life was among their fellow students. To capture the dynamic nature of social networks, we conducted multiple surveys throughout the academic year, measuring three dimensions of student relations: positive interaction , friendship, and studying together. We further collected self-reported measures of socioeconomic background (sex, age, first language, parental education, and support ties outside the university), abilities and motivation [high-school grade point average (GPA), study motivation, and time spent on studying], psychological well-being (stress, depression, and anxiety), and different types of peer perceptions (being perceived as smart) and behaviors (having a side job and free-time activities). Our study builds upon prior educational research in different scientific fields that looked into the relationship between social integration and academic performance. Prior work, for example , investigated the role of aggregated peer effects (14, 15), Significance Understanding the factors that explain academic failure and success of university students is a core interest of educational researchers, teachers, and managers. We demonstrate how the dynamic social networks that informally evolve between students can affect their academic performance. We closely followed the emergence of multiple social networks within a cohort of 226 undergraduate university students. They were strangers to each other on their first day at university, but developed densely knit social networks through time. We show that functional studying relationships tended to evolve from informal friendship relations. In a critical examination period after one year, these networks proved to be crucial: Socially isolated students had significantly lower examination grades and were more likely to drop out of university.},

abstract = {We study user behavior in the courses offered by a major Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) provider during the summer of 2013. Since social learning is a key element of scalable education in MOOCs and is done via online discussion forums, our main focus is in understanding forum activities. Two salient features of MOOC forum activities drive our research: 1. High decline rate: for all courses studied, the volume of discussions in the forum declines continuously throughout the duration of the course. 2. High-volume, noisy discussions: at least 30{\%} of the courses produce new discussion threads at rates that are infeasible for students or teaching staff to read through. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the discussions are not directly course-related. We investigate factors that correlate with the decline of activity in the online discussion forums and find effective strategies to classify threads and rank their relevance. Specifically, we use linear regression models to analyze the time series of the count data for the forum activities and make a number of observations, e.g., the teaching staff's active participation in the discussion increases the discussion volume but does not slow down the decline rate. We then propose a unified generative model for the discussion threads, which allows us both to choose efficient thread classifiers and design an effective algorithm for ranking thread relevance. Our ranking algorithm is further compared against two baseline algorithms, using human evaluation from Amazon Mechanical Turk. The authors on this paper are listed in alphabetical order.

abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) has emerged as a popular forum for users to pose questions for other users to answer. Over the last few years, CQA portals such as Naver and Yahoo! Answers have exploded in popularity, and now provide a viable alternative to general purpose Web search. At the same time, the answers to past questions submit- ted in CQA sites comprise a valuable knowledge repository which could be a gold mine for information retrieval and automatic question answering. Unfortunately, the quality of the submitted questions and answers varies widely - in- creasingly so that a large fraction of the content is not usable for answering queries. Previous approaches for retrieving relevant and high quality content have been proposed, but they require large amounts of manually labeled data – which limits the applicability of the supervised approaches to new sites and domains. In this paper we address this problem by developing a semi-supervised coupled mutual reinforce- ment framework for simultaneously calculating content qual- ity and user reputation, that requires relatively few labeled examples to initialize the training process. Results of a large scale evaluation demonstrate that our methods are more ef- fective than previous approaches for finding high-quality an- swers, questions, and users. More importantly, our quality estimation significantly improves the accuracy of search over CQA archives over the state-of-the-art methods.},

In this work, we show that all of the aforementioned models with negative sampling can be unified into the matrix factorization framework with closed forms. Our analysis and proofs reveal that: (1) DeepWalk empirically produces a low-rank transformation of a network's normalized Laplacian matrix; (2) LINE, in theory, is a special case of DeepWalk when the size of vertices' context is set to one; (3) As an extension of LINE, PTE can be viewed as the joint factorization of multiple networks' Laplacians; (4) node2vec is factorizing a matrix related to the stationary distribution and transition probability tensor of a 2nd-order random walk. We further provide the theoretical connections between skip-gram based network embedding algorithms and the theory of graph Laplacian. Finally, we present the NetMF method as well as its approximation algorithm for computing network embedding. Our method offers significant improvements over DeepWalk and LINE for conventional network mining tasks. This work lays the theoretical foundation for skip-gram based network embedding methods, leading to a better understanding of latent network representation learning.},

An- swers already have submitted millions of questions and received hundreds of millions of answers from other participants. However, it may also take hours –and sometime days– until a satisfactory an- swer is posted. In this paper we introduce the problemof predicting information seeker satisfaction in collaborative question answering communities, where we attempt to predict whether a question au- thor will be satisfied with the answers submitted by the community participants. We present a general prediction model, and de- velop a variety of content, structure, and community-focused fea- tures for this task. Our experimental results, obtained from a large- scale evaluation over thousands of real questions and user ratings, demonstrate the feasibility of modeling and predicting asker satis- faction. We complement our results with a thorough investigation of the interactions and information seeking patterns in question an- swering communities that correlate with information seeker satis- faction. Our models and predictions could be useful for a variety of applications such as user intent inference, answer ranking, interface design, and query suggestion and routing.},

abstract = {Traditional approaches to the prediction of suicide attempts have limited the accuracy and scale of risk detection for these dangerous behaviors. We sought to overcome these limitations by applying machine learning to electronic health records within a large medical database. Participants were 5,167 adult patients with a claim code for self-injury (i.e., ICD-9, E95x); expert review of records determined that 3,250 patients made a suicide attempt (i.e., cases), and 1,917 patients engaged in self-injury that was nonsuicidal, accidental, or nonverifiable (i.e., controls). We developed machine learning algorithms that accurately predicted future suicide attempts (AUC = 0.84, precision = 0.79, recall = 0.95, Brier score = 0.14). Moreover, accuracy improved from 720 days to 7 days before the suicide attempt, and predictor importance shifted across time. These findings represent a step toward accurate and scalable risk detection and provide insight into how suicide attempt risk shifts over time.},

abstract = {Community question answering services (CQAS) (e.g., Yahoo! Answers)
provides a platform where people post questions and answer questions
posed by others. Previous works analyzed the answer quality (AQ) based
on answer-related features, but neglect the question-related features on
AQ. Previous work analyzed how asker-and question-related features
affect the question quality (QQ) regarding the amount of attention from
users, the number of answers and the question solving latency, but
neglect the correlation between QQ and AQ (measured by the rating of the
best answer), which is critical to quality of service (QoS). We handle
this problem from two aspects. First, we additionally use QQ in
measuring AQ, and analyze the correlation between a comprehensive list
of features (including answer-related features) and QQ. Second, we
propose the first method that estimates the probability for a given
question to obtain high AQ. Our analysis on the Yahoo! Answers trace
confirmed that the list of our identified features exert influence on
AQ, which determines QQ. For the correlation analysis, the previous
classification algorithms cannot consider the mutual interactions
between multiple ({\textgreater}2) classes of features. We then propose a novel
Coupled Semi-Supervised Mutual Reinforcement-based Label Propagation
(CSMRLP) algorithm for this purpose. Our extensive experiments show that
CSMRLP outperforms the Mutual Reinforcement-based Label Propagation
(MRLP) and five other traditional classification algorithms in the
accuracy of AQ classification, and the effectiveness of our proposed
method in AQ prediction. Finally, we provide suggestions on how to
create a question that will receive high AQ, which can be exploited to
improve the QoS of CQAS.},

Applying the framework, we conduct experiments with Yahoo!

We examine the potential for leveraging social media postings as a new type of lens in understanding depression in populations. Information gleaned from social media bears potential to complement traditional survey techniques in its ability to provide finer grained measurements over time while radically expanding population sample sizes. We present work on using a crowdsourcing methodology to build a large corpus of postings on Twitter that have been shared by individuals diagnosed with clinical depression. Next, we develop a probabilistic model trained on this corpus to determine if posts could indicate depression. The model leverages signals of social activity, emotion, and language manifested on Twitter. Using the model, we introduce a social media depression index that may serve to characterize levels of depression in populations. Geographical, demographic and seasonal patterns of depression given by the measure confirm psychiatric findings and correlate highly with depression statistics reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)},

In measuring happiness, we use a real-time, remote-sensing, non-invasive, text-based approach---a kind of hedonometer. In building our metric, made available with this paper, we conducted a survey to obtain happiness evaluations of over 10,000 individual words, representing a tenfold size improvement over similar existing word sets. Rather than being ad hoc, our word list is chosen solely by frequency of usage and we show how a highly robust metric can be constructed and defended.},

abstract = {In recent months, significant media attention has focused on a new wave of school reformers who, in line with many of the requirements of Race to the Top federal incentives, promote more stringent accountability for teachers and charter schools as the solution to America's educational crisis. Best known for An Inconvenient Truth, Academy Award–winning director Davis Guggenheim offers in Waiting for “Superman” a disappointingly one-sided view of controversial reformers and their solutions to low-performing urban schools.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe film's premise is simple. It follows five students navigating the public school system and then interviews prominent educational reformers about how to improve the educational system. Over the course of 102 minutes, Guggenheim quicksteps us through an abbreviated version of American educational history and alerts us to an array of complex, multilayered, and persistent historical and societal problems. Given the enormity of challenges that American schools face, where Guggenheim chooses to go next is surprising. From the host of problems presented, he subtly guides the viewer toward what he perceives as the real problem of education: bad teachers and the unions that protect them. His solution, what the film presents as hope for salvation for all five children and their families: charter schools. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nPerhaps to seem unbiased, Guggenheim concedes that only one in five charter schools produces exceptional results. But any limitations are quickly overshadowed by his adoring portrayal of the exceptions, specifically the Harlem Children Zone's Promise Academy, KIPP's Los Angeles Prep, and Harlem Success Academy. Children in brightly colored, collared shirts eagerly raise their hands and boast of the number of books they've read. Focusing on a few exceptional schools as if they are typical, Guggenheim has found his superheroes and touts their successes with unrestrained zeal and an uncritical lens.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOf course, every superhero needs a nemesis, and Guggenheim wastes no time in identifying the perpetrators responsible for America's educational failure. To him, it's the teachers unions. The protected, tenured teacher waiting to collect her pension is the reason why America's children don't have a high-quality education. For example, the viewer sees footage from the early 1990s of a teacher reading a newspaper while his students sit listless at their desks. This level of neglect is what Guggenheim argues is happening in all neighborhood public schools. Frustrated that her son is trapped in an overcrowded school in the Bronx, which we are left to assume is filled with apathetic and disengaged teachers, one mother applies to a charter school believing, “If he doesn't get in, he doesn't have a chance.” $\backslash$n$\backslash$nGuggenheim capitalizes on the fears and hopes of these families, as evidenced in the final scene when we experience, alongside the children, the spectacle and theater of five charter school lotteries. Counting down the dwindling number of spaces left in the bottom corner of the screen, the shot zooms in on the heartbreak as four out of five students are denied enrollment. We are meant to feel outrage and grief. Yet, while Guggenheim capitalizes on the melodrama, the viewer feels emotionally manipulated; it seems that these children have been cruelly tricked into putting their unconditional faith in charter schools, only to be turned away, and we feel as if we were somehow in on it.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFor all of the glossing-over of facts, the incomplete or misleading statistics, and the unsupported claims, Guggenheim's biggest sins are those of omission. In this film, we never hear the voice of a single teacher. Simultaneously touted as both the problem and the solution, teachers are never given the opportunity to offer their views on “the problem” or “the answer.” What's worse is that Guggenheim lumps together and deems as failures the teachers who work in traditional public schools. According to the 2009 Digest of Education Statistics, these teachers work with 98 percent of the children in America who attend public schools. Nonetheless, if we are looking for committed teachers with high expectations and innovative ways of helping students learn, we needn't bother looking in public schools, Guggenheim seems to argue. Moreover, by portraying only families interested in pursuing space in charter schools, he seems to suggest that these are the parents who are committed to their children's education, while parents keeping their children in public schools are a part of the broken system.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nWaiting for “Superman” offers a solution for education that suggests that bad teachers and the unions that protect them are the source of systemic failure. What could be Guggenheim's aim in excluding the vast majority of America's teachers, students, and parents in his portrayal of American education? If political will and public conversation are his goals, then Guggenheim might have interviewed one parent or student group organizing to improve their neighborhood schools. Guggenheim patronizes viewers by suggesting that “problems in education are complex, but we have the answers.” For those in education who would rather engage in finding solutions, Waiting for “Superman” feels like precious time lost.},

However, it remains unclear why, or by what exact mechanism, celebrity suicides act to increase suicidal risk in the wider public due to the lack of data showing how the public understands and reacts to the suicide of well-known figures. This study used a supervised machine learning approach to investigate the emotional content of almost 1 million messages sent on Twitter related to the suicides of 18 prominent individuals in Japan between 2010 and 2014. The results revealed that different demographic characteristics of the deceased person (age, gender, and occupation) resulted in significant differences in emotional response; notably that the suicides of younger people, of women and of people in entertainment careers created more emotional responses (measured as a ratio of emotionally-coded tweets within the overall volume of tweets for each case) than for older people, men, and those in other careers. Moreover, certain types of emotional response were shown to correlate to subsequent rises in the national suicide counts, with “surprised” reactions being positively correlated with the suicide counts, while a high proportion of polite messages of condolence were negatively correlated. The study demonstrates the importance of, and describes a methodology for, considering the content of social media messages, not just their volume, in research into the mechanism by which these widely-reported deaths increase suicide risk in the broader public.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}},

abstract = {A substantial amount of evidence indicates that news coverage of suicide deaths by celebrities is followed by an increase in suicide rates, suggesting a copycat behavior. However, the underlying process by which celebrity status and media coverage leads to increases in subsequent suicides is still unclear. This study collected over 1 million individual messages (“tweets”) posted on Twitter that were related to 26 prominent figures in Japan who died by suicide between 2010 and 2014 and investigated whether media reports on suicide deaths that generated a greater level of reactions by the public are likely to be followed by a larger increase in actual suicides. We also compared the number of Twitter posts and the number of media reports in newspaper and on television to understand whether the number of messages on Twitter in response to the deaths corresponds to the amount of coverage in the traditional media. Using daily data from Japan's national death registry between 2010 and 2014, our analysis found an increase in actual suicides only when suicide deaths generated a large reaction from Twitter users. In contrast, no discernible increase in suicide counts was observed when the analysis included suicide deaths to which Twitter users did not show much interest, even when these deaths were covered considerably by the traditional media. This study also found suicides by relatively young entertainers generated a large number of posts on Twitter. This sharply contrasts with the relatively smaller volume of reaction to them generated by traditional forms of media, which focuses more on the deaths of non-entertainers. The results of this study strongly suggest that it is not sufficient to examine only traditional news media when investigating the impact of media reports on actual suicides.},

abstract = {Resolving ambiguity associated with names found on the Web, Wikipedia or medical texts is a very challenging task, which has been of great interest to the research community. We propose a novel approach to disambiguat-ing names using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, where the learned topics represent the under-lying senses of the ambiguous name. We con-duct a detailed evaluation on multiple data sets containing ambiguous person, location and or-ganization names and for multiple languages such as English, Spanish, Romanian and Bul-garian. We conduct comparative studies with existing approaches and show a substantial improvement of 15 to 35{\%} in task accuracy.},
